# Energy Open Source
This repository contains open-source energy-related software projects. If you would like your project included, leave a comment, pull request or email us [here](mailto:luke.marshall@student.unsw.edu.au). All projects welcome, regardless of status.

### [Local Solar Sharing Scheme Model](https://github.com/luke-marshall/embedded-network-model "Local Solar Sharing Model")
Intended for modelling embedded networks, local solar and peer to peer electricity networks. This software was developed by Naomi Stringer, Luke Marshall and Rob Passey at the UNSW Center for Energy and Environmental Markets (CEEM).

The project code can be found [here](https://github.com/luke-marshall/embedded-network-model "Local Solar Sharing Model").
A working build with a simple user interface for OSX can be found [here](https://github.com/luke-marshall/embedded-network-model/releases/tag/v0.2.0-beta).


### [Peer to Peer Meter Timing Simulation](https://github.com/luke-marshall/microgrid-timing "Peer to Peer Meter Timing")
A simple model that determines the impact of meter timing intervals (ie. 5-minute / 30-minute) on the accuracy of peer to peer energy accounting. 

Code can be found [here](https://github.com/luke-marshall/microgrid-timing "Peer to Peer Meter Timing").
